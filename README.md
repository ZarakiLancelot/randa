# UI Challenge - RANDA

This project is a UI challenge focused on creating a responsive navigation bar using vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap. The challenge demonstrates how to implement a mobile-first design with a functional hamburger menu, ensuring a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The navbar adjusts automatically to different screen sizes, with a hamburger menu appearing on smaller screens.
- **Mobile-First Approach**: The design prioritizes mobile devices, ensuring optimal usability on smartphones and tablets.
- **JavaScript Functionality**: Vanilla JavaScript is used to handle the toggling of the hamburger menu, ensuring that it works smoothly without relying on additional libraries.
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Leveraging Bootstrap’s grid system and components for quick and easy responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript for the logic behind the hamburger menu and responsive behavior.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for the grid system, layout, and basic styling.
- **HTML/CSS**: Standard markup and styling for structuring and designing the UI.
